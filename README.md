# To-Do-List-App
I have made a To Do List application using Html, CSS and JavaScript DOM(Document Object Model). In this application, user can divide tasks in different set of priorities.
Here Red shows very high priority , Blue shows high priority , Green shows medium priority and Black shows low priority.
Features :
1. Addition of tasks and set priority
  -> Click on plus button.
  -> Add task and set priority.
2. Edit tasks
  -> Click on unlock button
  -> Then, You can edit the task
  -> After completition of editing, You can click on lock button.
3. Change priority of tasks
  -> Click on task bar to change task priority.
4. Filter option ( to see same priority of task at a time )
  -> click on priority color button to see same priority of task at a time
  -> Double click on priority color button to see all the tasks at a time
5. Deletion of task.
  -> Click on cross button.
  -> Then cick on any task, then task will be deleted.
